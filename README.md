## Description: 
This project is a web-based version of the classic card game [concentration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(game)). It consists of a 4 by 4 grid
of 'cards' where each card contains a hidden emoji on the back. The goal of the game
is to match all the emoji's in the quickest time possible before running out of
stars. Each star represents a life, and the user loses a life when a certain number
of misses is hit. The particular number of misses depends on the difficulty chosen. 

The difficulty levels are easy, medium, hard, and very hard. It takes 5, 4, 3, and 2 misses
per life lost respectively. So if the user misses 25 times on easy, 20 times on medium, 15 times on hard, 
and 10 times on very hard, the game will be lost.

The speed, difficulty, and lives lost as you play the game is the way to compete against friends and yourself. A score
system and leaderboard board will be added upon next update to keep track of what a good game is and to add competition
amongst friends. Also further updates include sounds and animations as the game is played to continue improving the user experience.

## Purpose:     
To create a fun classic game and make it playable on any web browser/ device. Also my intention was to add a modern twist to a classic game by adding emoji's as the symbols to be matched. The game is fun and addictive and the different difficulty levels and the fact that it is timed adds a way to continuously make it more challenging.

## Contributions

- Udacity.com came up with the basic idea of the project. However, the idea they had was to create a matching game with a 4 by 4 grid of cards.

- Designed the UI and built all the code from scratch. All the files were created by me alone. 

## Browsers Supported:

- Tested on:
	- Google Chrome 
	- Safari
	- Digital simulator for many devices in all modes (i.e portrait, landscape, split screen for iPads) including:
		- iPhone 5/SE, 6/7/8, 6/7/8Plus, X
		- iPad (mini 7.9"), (9.7"), (Pro 10.5"), (Pro 12.9")
		- Galaxy S5
		- Pixel 2, 2XL

- Playable on touch devices, same UX as to on a browser

## How To Play:   

- First open the game in any browser of your choice 
	- If some browser/ device isn't supported feel free to contact me on GitHub so I can fix the issue and make the experience better for everyone :)
- Once the UI is visible the user should see:
	- The title and subtitle of the game
	- Some game data, including a reset button, some stars, and a time elapsed label
	- A 4 by 4 grid of 'cards'
- Click anywhere on the UI and a modal will pop up with further instructions. 
- Follow those instructions and enjoy the game :)


## Build:
- Use git clone on command line to clone this repository.
- Open the index.html in browser of choice. 

## Possible Future Updates
- Want to implement a score system (based on the time and difficulty level played)

- Want to implement a leader board

- Would like to add other game modes (like, for example, a mode where you try to collect the most cards in a row correctly out of some amount of cards)

- Would like to add a multiplayer mode, where people try to win the fastest, or the most correct cards consistently or somethinf

- Want to implement sounds to make the game more enganging

- Want to package it a cross platform mobile application (Android and IOS) with React.
